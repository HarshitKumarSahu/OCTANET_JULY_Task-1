In this project, I developed a dynamic and engaging landing page using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the integration of Locomotive.js and GSAP. Locomotive.js was utilized to ensure smooth scrolling, while GSAP was employed to create seamless animations. This task provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my web development skills and enhance my ability to create interactive web experiences.
